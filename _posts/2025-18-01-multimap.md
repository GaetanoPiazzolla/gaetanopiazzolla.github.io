Let's discover if code using `filter()` and `map()` could be inefficient for certain use cases and why `mapMulti()` could be a better alternative.

---
## What is mapMulti()?

Java Doc is Available [HERE](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html#mapMulti(java.util.function.BiConsumer)).
It's always great to read official javadoc. It contains useful stuff.

If you prefer a more human explanation instead, here it is:

**1) It's a one-to-many intermediate operation. Every element can be transformed into 0 or more elements.**
Which basically means it can be used to filter out elements, but also to transform them.
That's why we can choose it instead of using `filter()` and `map()` chained together.

**2) It differs from the `flatMap()` method because it doesn't require a Stream to be returned.**
That's why it's more efficient than `flatMap()` when we also need to filter elements.

Now we will try to provide alternative solutions to a problem using `mapMulti()`.
Then we will compare the performance of the solutions using [JMH](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh).

## Problem Definition
    Given a list of Strings representing numbers, 
    extract only the even integers from the list.

Some Examples:

    ["1", "error", "42", "3", "banana", "4"] -> [42, 4]
    ["1", "error", "3", "banana"] -> []

### Solution 1: filter() and map()

The standard code everyone would write might look like this using `filter()`:

```java
var evenNumbers = lines.stream()
        .filter(line -> {
            try {
                return Integer.parseInt(line) % 2 == 0;
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                return false;
            }
        })
        .map(Integer::parseInt) 
        .toList();
```

The first `filter()` parses the string to check if it's even. Then `map()` parses the same string again to convert it into an integer.
This results in redundant work. We are calling the _parseInt()_ method twice for each valid element.

### Solution 2: flatMap()

The `flatMap()` approach avoids redundant parsing but introduces another inefficiency:

```java
var evenNumbers = lines.stream()
        .flatMap(line -> {
            try {
                if(Integer.parseInt(line) % 2 == 0) {
                    return Stream.of(Integer.parseInt(line));
                }
                return Stream.empty();
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                return Stream.empty();
            }
        })
        .toList();
```

While it solves the double parsing issue, it creates a new stream for each line, even for invalid entries.
This adds overhead due to the repeated allocation of stream objects and additional iterations over the data.

### Solution 3: mapMulti()

With `mapMulti()` we can solve both problems by avoiding double parsing and the useless stream creations:

```java
var evenNumbers = lines.stream()
        .<Integer>mapMulti((line, consumer) -> {
            try {
                int number = Integer.parseInt(line);
                if (number % 2 == 0) {
                    consumer.accept(number);
                }
            } catch (NumberFormatException ignored) { }
        })
        .toList();
```

This code is pretty nasty, but we can say it's the most efficient solution.
It avoids creating a new stream for each line and eliminates the need for double parsing.

## Performance Comparison:

We will use JMH to compare the performance of the three solutions.

```java
@BenchmarkMode(Mode.AverageTime)
@Warmup(iterations = 3)
@Measurement(iterations = 5)
@Fork(1)
@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
@State(Scope.Thread)
public class ProblemBenchmark {

    private List<String> lines;

    @Setup
    public void prepare() {
        Random random = new Random();
        lines = Stream.generate(() -> {
            if (random.nextInt(10) == 0) {
                return "error";
            } else {
                return String.valueOf(random.nextInt(1000));
            }
        }).limit(10000).toList();
    }

    @Benchmark
    public List<Integer> filterMap() {
        return lines.stream()
                .filter(line -> {
                    try {
                        return Integer.parseInt(line) % 2 == 0;
                    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                        return false;
                    }
                })
                .map(Integer::parseInt)
                .toList();
    }

    @Benchmark
    public List<Integer> flatMap() {
        return lines.stream()
                .flatMap(line -> {
                    try {
                        int number = Integer.parseInt(line);
                        if (number % 2 == 0) {
                            return Stream.of(number);
                        }
                        return Stream.empty();
                    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                        return Stream.empty();
                    }
                })
                .toList();
    }

    @Benchmark
    public List<Integer> mapMulti() {
        return lines.stream()
                .<Integer>mapMulti((line, consumer) -> {
                    try {
                        int number = Integer.parseInt(line);
                        if (number % 2 == 0) {
                            consumer.accept(number);
                        }
                    } catch (NumberFormatException ignored) { }
                })
                .toList();
    }

}
```

As you might imagine,
the results show that `mapMulti()` is faster than `filter().map()` and `flatMap()` other than being less error-prone.

| Benchmark | Mode | Cnt  | Score | Error   | Units  |
|-----------|------|------|-------|---------|--------|
| mapMulti  | avgt | 5    | 0,690 | ± 0,017 | ms/op  |
| flatMap   | avgt | 5    | 0,722 | ± 0,018 | ms/op  |
| filterMap | avgt | 5    | 0,758 | ± 0,037 | ms/op  |

## Filter() + Map() Inherent (but small) Inefficiency

When you use `.filter().map()`, the operations are applied lazily as part of a single stream pipeline.
The stream itself doesn't create a new stream but chains operations.
However, each operation adds a layer of processing that could introduce overhead.

- Each `.filter()` and `.map()` call adds a separate step in the pipeline.
- Every element flows through all intermediate operations, adding a level of indirection.
- Each step adds a function call overhead, even if the function is simple.

Even if with [JIT optimizations](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/geninfo/diagnos/underst_jit.html), the overhead is minimal, it's still there.

If we try to run a benchmark to compare the performance of `filter().map()` vs. `mapMulti()`,
without any extra logic performing the same exact operations, we can see that `mapMulti()` is faster.

Benchmark Summary:

- filterMap: Average Time = 143.193 microseconds ± 2.278
- mapMulti: Average Time = 129.308 microseconds ± 0.796

In this case, `mapMulti()` is faster than `filter().map()` by about 10%.
On a huge dataset, the performance difference could be significant.
Also, the error margin is smaller for `mapMulti()`.
This is because `mapMulti()` avoids the overhead of chaining
multiple steps and reduces the number of functional calls.

## Conclusion

While `filter()`+`map()` and `flatMap()` are useful, `mapMulti()` offers a more efficient and streamlined
way to filter and transform data in Java Streams.

Next time you're working with transformations where filtering and mapping overlap,
consider using `mapMulti()` for cleaner and more efficient code.
It reduces redundant operations, avoids extra stream creation, and simplifies the transformation logic.

### When to use filter() then?

1) when you just need to filter elements without transformation or additional logic

2) when the stream dataset is small (vast majority of standard use cases)

3) when you want to ensure the code is more readable and maintainable. mapMulti code is nasty.

4) when you don't care about the performance difference (who does?)

5) when you don't want to use a new method that you don't know yet

Thanks to [José Paumard](https://www.youtube.com/@JosePaumard) for this [great lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqUhObgDd5Q)
where he explains the benefits of `mapMulti()` as a prerequisite to understand the new
streams Gatherer API method that will be released in JDK 24.

### Bonus: Alternative (and faster) Solutions

In this code we have considered just `filter()` and `mapMulti()`, but there are other ways to solve this problem.
This was not the scope of the article, but here are some examples:

Regex:

```java
var evenNumbers = lines.stream()
    .filter(line -> line.matches("\\d+") && Integer.parseInt(line) % 2 == 0)
    .map(Integer::parseInt)
    .toList();
```

Plain old Basic For Loop:

```java
var result = new java.util.ArrayList<Integer>();
for(String line: lines) {
    try {
        int number = Integer.parseInt(line);
        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            result.add(number);
        }
    } catch (NumberFormatException ignored) { }
}
return result;
```

For the sake of completeness, I have also benchmarked these solutions.
Here are the results:

| Benchmark | Mode | Cnt | Score  | Error   | Units |
|-----------|------|-----|--------|---------|-------|
| regex     | avgt |  5  | 0.513  | ± 0.109 | ms/op |
| forLoop   | avgt |  5  | 0.610  | ± 0.015 | ms/op |


### Bonus 2: how things change with parallel streams

With parallel streams, the overhead of `filter().map()` is reduced,
and the performance difference is way smaller than before.
When we have multiple cores, the overhead of chaining operations is negligible.

Nice!
